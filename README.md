This is a toy project aimed at developing practical `C` programming skills as part of the HarvardX CS50x course (CS50's Introduction to Computer Science).

This project was created to explore sorting algorithms and their implementation on linked lists using the C programming language.

### Roadmap:

- Move each sorting case into a separate thread
- Each sorting case should render only its own chart
- Add tracking for the number of shifts, swaps, and other operations performed during sorting
- Add information about memory usage
